# Machine Learning Pipeline for Regression

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to solve a regression problem using **RandomForestRegressor** and explores methods to improve accuracy. It includes:
- Preprocessing of numeric and categorical features.
- Model training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Generating predictions on a test dataset.
- Creating a submission file for evaluation.

## Dataset
The project uses a train-test split provided in the competition. The files include:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with features and target.
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data where predictions need to be made.
- `sample_submission.csv`: Template for the submission file.

### Target Variable
The target column (replace `target` with the actual column name) is the variable to predict using the regression models.

## Pipeline Description
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Numeric Features**:
     - Imputation using the median.
     - Scaling using `StandardScaler`.
   - **Categorical Features**:
     - Imputation using the most frequent value.
     - One-hot encoding to handle categorical variables.

2. **Modeling**:
   - A **RandomForestRegressor** is used as the baseline model.
   - The pipeline integrates preprocessing and model training for seamless operation.

3. **Validation**:
   - Split the training data into training and validation sets (80-20 split).
   - Evaluate model performance using the R² score.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use **GridSearchCV** to optimize key parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.

5. **Submission**:
   - Generate predictions on the test dataset.
   - Save results to a CSV file formatted according to `sample_submission.csv`.

## Model Tuning and Evaluation
- The model performance is measured using the **R² score** on the validation set.
- Hyperparameter tuning significantly improves the performance of the model.
